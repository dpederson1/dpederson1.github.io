											<h3>Biography</h3>
											<p>Dakota Pederson (b. 1999) became interested in composition at an early age. He first began by writing Concert Band works for his middle
											school band, where he had his 1st world premier. He would then go on to have two more world
											premiers: one with the NWI Youth Symphony Orchestra, and another with his high school band. Since then, his most successful composition, Spring Dances, would go on to
											win the first annual MakeMusic Young Composers Contest in 2017, and later be published by Grand Mesa Music. Since then, Dakota has continued to write concert band works
											while he pursues his degree in Music Education. 
											
											</p>

											<p>Dakota was the recipient of the 2017 MakeMusic Young Composers Competition Grand Prize
											with his work, Spring Dances. Dakota was a Finalist in the TI:ME Competition Contest, and
											the finalist in the MakeMusic 2018 Young Composers Contest. Recently, Dakota was the winner of the 
											2020-21 Association of Concert Bands Young Composers Composition Contest in partnership with the John Philip Sousa Foundation with his latest work, Ambush. He was also the recipient of the John Philip
											Sousa Award (2018). Dakota's work is currently published and sold by Grand Mesa Music and J.W. Pepper.
